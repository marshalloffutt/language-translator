# Language Translator for a Halloween Card

## Description
This is a very limited language translator app, where the user can type Halloween-ish words into the input field, and the app will translate those words into Bulgarian, Greek, or Icelandic. This project is an exploration of JavaScript functions using arrays, for loops, and conditional statements.
